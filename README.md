##What is QMGsurvey?

QMGsurvey (released at https://github.com/laurinjfelder/QMGsurvey) is a Mathematica based program that can be used to analyse quantum matrix geometries, based on the algorithms from https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10206.
See https://github.com/laurinjfelder/QMGsurvey/wiki for more information and documentation.

###How to use QMGsurvey?

The file QMGsurvey.wl represents the main package of this software. It collacts the methods that allow the investigation of a given matrix configuration.
The file QMGxX.wl can be used to construct points in target space and matrix configurations (the SU(3) matrices are constructed based on https://arxiv.org/abs/0908.3864 by Richard Shurtleff).

The folder examples contains many examples, demonstrating and explaining the usage of QMGsurvey.wl and QMGxX.wl.

In order to use QMGsurvey.wl and QMGxX.wl, these have to be imported into a Mathematica notebook or similar.

For further documentation, see https://github.com/laurinjfelder/QMGsurvey/wiki.

# QMG
This package implements (some of) the algorithms from https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10206, allowing for calculations concerning Quantum Matrix Geometries.

The construction of the matrix configuration of the fuzzy CP2 is based on https://arxiv.org/abs/0908.3864 by Richard Shurtleff, published under CC-BY-4.0 license https://github.com/teamdigitale/licenses/blob/master/CC-BY-4.0. Some small modifications have been made.
